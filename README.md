## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
-   A free [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) account

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    
    ```

    ```

3.  **Install NPM packages**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up Environment Variables**
    -   Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project.
    -   Add your MongoDB Atlas connection string and a JWT secret to this file. Remember to replace `<password>` with your database user password and specify a database name (e.g., `echopulse`).

      ```env
      # MongoDB Connection String
      DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://your_username:<password>@your_cluster.mongodb.net/echopulse?retryWrites=true&w=majority

      # JWT Secret (generate a long, random string)
      JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_that_is_long
      ```

5.  **Run the development server**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
